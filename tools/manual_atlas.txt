"description": "The Ohio State University (OSU) is located in Columbus, Ohio, USA.  OSU's school colors are scarlet and gray which can be seen around their famous Block O - located towards the bottom left of the artwork.  The Block "O" together with the Buckeye nut is the logo for The Ohio State University. OSU (not to be confused with the rhythm game "osu!") is famous for it's rivalry with the University of Michigan with the 15-2 representing the current streak of 15 wins against UofM's 2. The Ohio flag is on the top right, representing the state of Ohio, USA. The bottom right has the famous "Script Ohio" - a long-time Ohio State tradition from the school's Marching Band where members of the band will form the word "Ohio" in script during football games. A second block "O" is situated next to Purdue University & Rutgers University elsewhere on r/place.",

**How to contribute?**Anyone can suggest additions to [the Atlas](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/).

**Adding an entry**

To add a new entry, [follow this link](https://place-atlas.stefanocoding.me/?mode=draw) and draw a shape around the region you'd like to describe.Make sure that the lines you're drawing don't form a [self-intersecting polygon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Complex_polygon.svg/288px-Complex_polygon.svg.png).

When you're happy with the shape you've drawn, press Enter.You will now be able to enter some information about the highlighted region:

* Name: A short, descriptive name.
* Description: A short description that will also be understood by somebody not familiar with the topic. Usually, the first sentence on Wikipedia is a good example.
* Website: If you're describing a project, the project's main website would be suitable here.
* Subreddit: The subreddit that's either most relevant to the topic, or that was responsible for creating the artwork. Format it like this: "r/subreddit".

All fields but the name are optional.A country flag doesn't need a description, for example.

Once you've entered all the information, you'll be presented with a pop-up window containing some [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-formatted data. Copy the entire JSON text, and create a new text post to this subreddit.

Remember to flair your post with "**New Entry**".

**Changing existing entries**  
Currently, you'll just have to make a new post with the "Edit Entry" flair and describe which post should be changed in what form.
